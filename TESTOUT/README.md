# Templates and test outputs

The `TESTOUT` folder contains Tecplot layout files to help visualise the RSVS
results and the outputs from the test suite.

## Contents

Unfortunately all the nice visualisation provided in this folder are locked
behind a Tecplot license...

Without a tecplot license visualisation of many of those results can be found in
Chapter 7 of ["Shape and Topology Optimisation of External Flows" (thesis)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/345149497_Shape_and_Topology_Optimisation_of_External_Flows).

### Tecplot Templates

The `TESTOUT/layouts/` directory contains [Tecplot-360](https://www.tecplot.com/)
layout files for viewing the results. Those templates are automatically picked
up and specialised to the files generated by the process.

### Test outputs

Many of the tests output files to allow offline visualisation of the outcomes,
those files often have an associated layout file.
